## Description

- Code
  - `utils.R` is a code for functions used for signal fitting and visualization.
  - `motivation.R` provides a code for motivating examples.
  - `simulation_robustfit.R` and `simulation_structure.R` are codes for simulation study.
  - `realdata_structure.R` is a code for real data analysis.
