# Quantile-based fitting for graph signals

This repo contains the source code for quantile-based fitting for graph signals.


## Description

- Code
  - `utils.R` is a code for functions used for signal fitting and visualization.
  - `motivation.R` provides a code for motivating examples.
  - `simulation_robustfit.R` and `simulation_structure.R` are codes for simulation study.
  - `realdata_structure.R` is a code for real data analysis.

- Data
  - `Manhattan_zones.csv` contains Manhattan zones information in NYC.
  - `US_Hourly_2010_August_1st.mata` contains data of hourly temperature measurements recorded in Fahrenheit across the United States on August 1, 2010.
  

## Code overview
We present a quantile-based fitting method for graph signals, applying it to diverse simulation scenarios and real-world datasets.
